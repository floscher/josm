The XML Parser is JDOM 1.0 and came from www.jdom.org. 
It is licensed under "JDOM license", a modified Apache License
with Aknowledgement removed.

The icons are inspired and stolen from gnome-media package 
of my local linux installation. The images are licensed 
under LGPL but redistributed by me under the terms of GPL 2.0.

The UTM - code is a rewritten version from Ben who had it from 
some old C code. Aknowledgments are in the UTM.java file of 
the source distribution.

All the rest are belongs to me.

Imi.
