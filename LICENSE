JOSM License
============

JOSM, and all its integral parts, are released under the GNU General 
Public License.

Earlier contributions to JOSM did not specifiy a version of that license,
but the license included in the distribution was version 2. 

All contributions made on or after 15 April 2008 are explicitly "GPL 
v2 or later".

This is valid for all files released in the JOSM subversion tree, even
if they do not carry their own copyright or license information.

According to the current JOSM maintainer, it is safe to assume that all
previous contributions are also "GPL v2 or later", but an effort will 
be made to contact the past contributors to have full clarity.

The GPL v3 is accessible here:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

The GPL v2 is accessible here:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html

Note: This is not valid for JOSM plugins. These are not considered
an integral part of JOSM and may be under any license.
