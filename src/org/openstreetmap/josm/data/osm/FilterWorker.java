     * Apply the filters to the primitives of the data set.
     *
     * There are certain rules to ensure that a way is not displayed "naked"
     * without its nodes (1) and on the other hand to avoid hiding a way but
     * leaving its nodes visible as a cloud of points (2).
     *
     * In normal (non-inverted) mode only problem (2) is relevant.
     * Untagged child nodes of filtered ways that are not used by other
     * unfiltered ways are filtered as well.
     *
     * If a filter applies explicitly to a node, (2) is ignored and it
     * is filtered in any case.
     *
     * In inverted mode usually only problem (1) is relevant.
     * If the inverted filter applies explicitly to a node, this no longer
     * means it is filtered in any case:
     * E.g. the filter [searchtext="highway=footway", inverted=true] displays
     * the footways only. But that does not mean, the nodes of the footway
     * (which do not have the highway tag) should be filtered as well.
     *
     * So first the Filter is applied for ways and relations. Then to nodes
     * (but hides them only if they are not used by any unfiltered way).
