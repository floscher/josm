summary: Editor for OpenStreetMap
description: |
 JOSM is an extensible editor for ​OpenStreetMap (OSM) written in Java.
 It supports loading GPX tracks, background imagery and OSM data from
 local sources as well as from online sources and allows to edit the
 OSM data (nodes, ways and relations) and their metadata tags.
 JOSM is open source and licensed under GPL​.
 
 OpenStreetMap is a project aimed squarely at creating and providing
 free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them.
 The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually
 have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people
 from using them in creative, productive or unexpected ways.
