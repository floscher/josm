This is a readme.txt to the Java OpenStreetMap Editor


Install Notes
-------------

To run JOSM, you need:

* The jar file (e.g. josm.jar)
* The latest Java Runtime Environment 1.6. 


How to get Java
---------------

You need at least Version 1.6 (called Java6). 

Microsoft Windows people should just visit java.sun.com and
download the latest Java6 executable. 

To get Java under linux, either download the environment 
directly from Sun at http://java.sun.com (there is a linux 
binary installer which you have to execute from a console) or
use the mechanisms of your distributions packaging system.

How to launch
-------------

Microsoft Windows people launch by double clicking on the jar file.
If this does not help, open a command shell and type 
"java -jar josm-latest.jar" in the directory that holds the file.
(Please replace josm-latest.jar with the name of your jar file, if
you don't used the latest version.)

Under Linux open a shell, go to the file directory and type
"java -jar josm-latest.jar" to launch. If this don't help, try to set
you JAVA_HOME variable to the java location (the root location, not
the bin)

MacOS people just click on the jar-file.


How to get the Source

https://josm.openstreetmap.de/svn/trunk. To use the command line
subverion client, type
