Supplemental information for JOSM -- the Java OpenStreetMap Editor


Installation notes
------------------
To run JOSM, you need:

* The JOSM .jar file, e.g., josm-tested.jar or josm-latest.jar
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6, or later. 


How to get Java Runtime Environment
-----------------------------------
You need JRE Version 1.6 (also called Java6), or later. 

Microsoft Windows users should visit 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html 
and download the latest Java6 executable for Windows systems.

Linux users should visit http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html
There is a Linux binary installer, which you must execute from a console, or 
use the mechanism of your distribution's packaging system.


How to launch
-------------
Microsoft Windows users launch by double-clicking on the .jar file.
If this does not work, open a command shell and type
"java -jar josm-latest.jar"  in the directory that holds the file. (Please
replace josm-latest.jar with the name of your .jar file, if you aren't using
the latest version.)

Under Linux, open a shell, go to the file directory and type
"java -jar josm-latest.jar" to launch. If this does not work, try to set
your JAVA_HOME variable to the java executable location (the root location, 
not the bin).

MacOS users just click on the .jar file icon.


How to get the source code
--------------------------
Download it directly from the subversion at 
https://josm.openstreetmap.de/svn/trunk. To use the command line subversion 
client, type
