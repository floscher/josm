This is a readme.txt to the Java OpenStreetMap Editor Beta


Install Notes
-------------

To run JOSM, you need:

* josm-beta.jar
* The latest Java Runtime Environment 1.5. 



How to get Java
---------------

You need at least Version 1.5 (called Java5 or "Tiger"). 

Microsoft Windows people should just visit java.sun.com and
download the latest Java5 executable. 

To get Java under linux, I recommend downloading the environment 
directly from Sun at http://java.sun.com. There is a linux 
binary installer which you have to execute from a java console.

However, if you run Debian or Ubuntu or any other dpkg-based
distribution, you may use unofficial precompiled packages.
You have to add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list
(replace "stable" with your installation)

http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian/ stable non-free

The package is called sun-j2se5.0-jdk-binary.

Good news for MacOS: In Tiger Release Java5 is already included.
The bad news for non-Tigers: There are no Java5 available.


How to launch
-------------

Microsoft Windows people launch by double clicking on josm-beta.jar.
If this does not help, open a command shell and type 
"java -jar josm-beta.jar" in the directory that holds the file.

Under Linux open a shell, go to the file directory and type
"java -jar josm-beta.jar" to launch. If this don't help, try to set
you JAVA_HOME variable to the java location (the root location, not
the bin. "/usr/lib/sun-j2se5.0-jdk" if you used the prebuild 
package).

MacOS people just click on the jar-file.


How to get the Source
---------------------

Download it from http://www.eigenheimstrasse.de/josm/josm-beta-src.zip
or directly from the subversion at 
http://www.eigenheimstrasse.de/svn/josm. The beta is Revision 12.
