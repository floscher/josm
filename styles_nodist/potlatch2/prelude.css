/*

	Potlatch 2 core stylesheet
	
	This stylesheet should contain commonly used features and only the most essential extra attributes
	(e.g. oneway). It needs to remain simple (not too many nested styles or dash-type decorations) in
	order not to kill performance on slower systems and those with a less effective Flash Player (i.e. 
	Linux).
	
	It is expected that experienced mappers will switch between this and other stylesheets as required.
